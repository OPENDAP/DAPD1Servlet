# The DAPServerBaseURL is the URL for the server that will be used to
# answer questions about datasets. All of the data this D1 Member Node
# accesses comes from this server. The ping() function uses this.
#
# Note that there is an issue here because the database used by this
# servlet can hold urls from any DAP server. By convention, they should
# only access data from this server.

### response for the MN. They may be used in other ways, too.

# include a trailing slash.
