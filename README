This is a prototype DAP/DataONE servlet. It provides a way to access data
using the DataONE protocol when those data are served using DAP. Any DAP
server can be used, so long as it can package results in NetCDF files and
can return ISO 19115 documents for those data results.

Installation

Configuration

Two files need to be edited to configure the server.

Apache Tomcat's configuration file is CATALINA_HOME/conf/catalina.properties.
In Tomcat's 'catalina.properties' add:

    org.apache.tomcat.util.buf.UDecoder.ALLOW_ENCODED_SLASH=true
    org.apache.catalina.connector.CoyoteAdapter.ALLOW_BACKSLASH=true

The servlet's configuration file is CATALINA_HOME/webapps/DAPD1Servlet
/WEB-INF/classes/opendap.properties.

In the servlet's 'opendap.properties' edit these lines:

# The 'base URL' for this web service will be 'serviceName' + 'nodeType'.
# ie, .../DAPD1Servelet/d1/mn/. Other stuff like 'node' gets appended to
# that to make a request. In this string, just edit the host and port. Don't
# include a trailing slash.
org.opendap.d1.serviceName = http://localhost:8080/DAPD1Servlet/d1

# This is the name of the SQLite database that holds information about 
# PIDs and the DAP URLs and other stuff they map too.
org.opendap.d1.DatabaseName = /Users/jimg/src/dataone/DatasetsDatabase/test.db

# nodeName is used as a label
org.opendap.d1.nodeName = test.opendap.org

# nodeId must never change; this will have a cert and must match the regex
# urn:node:[\w_]{2,23} That is, 2 to 23 character long strings of '_' and 
# characters that can make up a word. Dots (.) do not match \w
org.opendap.d1.nodeId = urn:node:test_opendap_org

# X.509 Distinguished Name; can be used with an X509 cert; can be repeated
# ...Except that these are read-only, public nodes, so don't change this
# (although the code doesn't check auth credentials yet... 6/4/14)
org.opendap.d1.subject = public:

# Contact point for the servlet. This must be a RFC2253-compliant string
# see http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2253.txt
org.opendap.d1.contactSubject = CN=James Gallagher,O=OPeNDAP,C=US

org.opendap.d1.nodeDescription = This node contains test data.
