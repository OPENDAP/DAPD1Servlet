This is a prototype DAP/DataONE servlet. It provides a way to access data
using the DataONE protocol when those data are served using DAP. Any DAP
server can be used, so long as it can package results in NetCDF files and
can return ISO 19115 documents for those data results. 

The project builds a war file that is used with Apache Tomcat 7.

Building the code

This project and its companion use Maven. Build it using 'mvn package'.

Goto ttp://maven.apache.org/download.cgi, getn the binary and install
it. On a Mac OSX machine, put the apache-maven-<ver> directory in
/Applications. Then add

export M2_HOME=/Applications/apache-maven-3.1.1
export PATH=$PATH:$M2_HOME/bin

to .bashrc or the equivalent. mvn --version should work and return the
expected info.

Configuration

See the online docs at http://opendap.github.io/DAPD1Servlet for help on
configuring the server. Note that you'll need to get its companion project
DAPD1DatasetsDatabase (https://opendap.github.com/DAPD1DatasetsDatabase)
to build/edit/customize the datasets this server accesses. The documention
covers this in detail.
